## Usage
Make sure Node installed. I recommend using [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to manage versions.

This has been tested on Node `0.12.x` - `5.9.0`, and should work on newer versions as well. [File an issue](https://github.com/huangguozhen/molmc-extension/issues) if it doesn't!

#### Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

#### Run devlopment tasks:
```
npm start
```
Aliases: `npm run gulp`, `npm run development`

This is where the magic happens. The perfect front-end workflow. This runs the default gulp task, which starts compiling, watching, and live updating all our files as we change them. BrowserSync will start a server on port 3000, or do whatever you've configured it to do. You'll be able to see live changes in all connected browsers. Don't forget about the additional BrowserSync tools available on port 3001!

Why run this as an npm script? NPM scripts add ./node_modules/bin to the path when run, using the packages version installed with this project, rather than a globally installed ones. Never `npm install -g` and get into mis-matched version issues again. These scripts are defined in the `scripts` property of `package.json`.

#### Run in tests in watch mode:
```bash
npm run test:watch
```

#### Run tests once:
```bash
npm run test
```

#### Build production files:
```bash
npm run production
```
